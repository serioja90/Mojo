Mojo - 3D editor
================

Mojo is an C++ Qt4 based application, that provides the necessary tools for 3D models creation. Basically Mojo allows
to read from *.xml files with particular tags and generate a 3D model.
The application was tested only on Ubuntu, so there isn't any guarantee that it will work fine on another
operating systems.

Installation
------------
Before compile the Mojo project you need the Qt4 library installed on your computer, so if you don't have the
Qt4 library installed, you can install it by following the instructions below.

### GNU/Linux Debian distributions ###
Open a shell by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and paste the following command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-dev libqt4-gui qt4-dev-tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will automatically install and compile the Qt4 library and now you will be able to compile the Mojo project.
For doing this you have to move to the folder with the project and execute the following command:

~~~~~~~~
make -j4
~~~~~~~~

The ``-j4`` option is optional, but if your computer have more then one core it's better to use this option.

Source Code Documentation
-------------------------
The documentation of the source code can be automatically generated by using the doxygen application, that can be
installed by running in your shell:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sudo apt-get install doxygen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then move to the Mojo project directory and execute the following command in your shell:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
doxygen mojo_doc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will create all the necessary documentation.
