Mojo - 3D editor
================

Mojo is an C++ application that allows to create 3D models by defining them in a *.xml file.
Actually in development...

Mojo is a Qt based application, so to compile it you will need the Qt4 library installed.
If you are using GNU/Linux OS debian based just run:

<code>sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-dev libqt4-gui qt4-dev-tools</code>

Then run the <code>make</code> command, that will compile the entire project.
